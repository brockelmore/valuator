Stock Valuator

A package that gets input data about company filings and uses different valuation methods to come up with price range for stock prices.

Some useful measures:

Working Capital:
The difference between current assets and current liabilities
Current assets (CA):
    - Cash and cash equivalents
    - Accounts receivable
    - Short term investments
Current Liabilities (CL):
    - Accounts payable
    - Short term debt (due in the next year)
    - Interest and tax payable for the year
    
WC = CA - CL
Current Ratio = CA/CL
